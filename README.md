# A Neural Network in just a few Lines of Python Code
## Design a Feed Forward Neural Network with Backpropagation Step by Step with real Numbers

In this tutorial we will construct a feed forward neural network with backpropagation from scratch. We will develop the math and the code in parallel. As in the last machine learning tutorials, we will use jupyter notebooks, so you can easily get the code and description in one place.
